## Project Linear Regression Analysis

This project applies linear regression techniques to analyze and predict gold prices dataset. The objective is to explore the relationship between variables, ensure model interpretability, and build a reliable model for prediction.

## Methodology
Before constructing the regression model, key assumptions were examined to validate the model's suitability:

- **Linearity**

- **Multicollinearity**

- **Homoscedasticity**

- **Independence**

- **Normality**

- **Outliers**

These checks ensure the robustness and reliability of the regression analysis and help in understanding the role of each variable in influencing gold prices.

## Dataset
- **Name of dataset**: Gold Futures Historical Data (23.01.24-22.11.24) Dataset.
- **Source of dataset**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kapturovalexander/gold-and-silver-prices-2013-2023?resource=download&select=Gold+Futures+Historical+Data+%2823.01.24-22.11.24%29.csv)
